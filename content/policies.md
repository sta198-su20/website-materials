### Important Administrative Details

STA 198L is a unique two-part online course that spans both summer sessions at Duke University. This course is split into two half-credit sessions: STA 198L-1 and STA 198L-2. **Students must enroll in and complete both sections within the same summer in order to receive credit**. 

This course will be graded on the traditional letter scale. All students will receive a Z grade upon completion of STA 198L-1. Students will only be allowed to enroll in STA 198L-2 upon completion of STA 198L-1 in the immediately preceding summer session. After finishing STA 198L-2, the instructor will assign a traditional letter grade for *both* STA 198L-1 and STA 198L-2. The *same grade* will be assigned across both STA 198L-1 and STA 198L-2, as this is effectively one course taught across two sessions. 

If the student does not take STA 198L-2 during the same summer as STA 198L-1, the Z grade will remain on the record and the student will not receive credit for the course. That is, completion of STA 198L-1 *without* completion of STA 198L-2 in the immediately following summer term will result in **no credit**. 

### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is of paramount importance in this class, and all work must be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard, reproduced as follows:

To uphold the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard):
- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the provisions of the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) as well as the policies specific to this course. Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment, be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action, and potentially a failing (F) course grade depending on the magnitude of the offense.
<br> 
<br>

### Activities & Assessments

#### Lecture

All lectures will be pre-recorded and posted to the course page. Each live class session will be held on Zoom and consist of a lecture recap and a Q&A session. The recording of the live class session will also be posted to the course page. Attendance is not mandatory, but students are responsible for content contained the pre-recorded lectures and live Q&A sessions according to the course schedule.
<br> 
<br>

#### Homework (20%)

Eight (8) graded homework assignments focus on understanding methods, performing data analysis, and reinforcing concepts from lecture. Feel free to discuss homework with other students -- however, all work must be your own. Homework assignments must be typed as an R Markdown document and uploaded to Gradescope and linked to a private GitHub repository prior to the due date in order to receive credit. Unlimited resubmissions are allowed until the due date. Only the final version will be graded.

*No late homework is accepted, but the lowest grade will be dropped automatically.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Labs (20%)

Six (6) graded labs focus on computing tools needed to tackle analysis of real-world datasets and may be individual or team-based. No late labs are accepted, but the lowest grade will be dropped automatically. Three (3) bonus labs will be assigned but not graded. Attendance is not required, but TAs will be available during four live lab sessions to accommodate different time zones. Unlimited resubmissions are allowed until the due date. Only the final version will be graded.

*No late labs are accepted, but the lowest grade will be dropped automatically.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Exams (45%)

Three (3) asynchronous midterm exams test understanding, analysis, and interpretation of methods. Each exam corresponds to one of the three units. All exams are open-note, open-internet, etc., with the strict exception that students are not permitted to communicate or collaborate with *anyone* regarding the exam (except the professor). To accommodate students in different time zones, exams will be administered electronically on Gradescope: a 12-hour window will be provided during which students will have up to 2 hours (to allow for technical difficulties and slower typists!) to take the exam. 

*Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-ups will be given.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Project (15%)

The final research project is an open-ended statistical analysis that answers a research question of interest using a real-world dataset. To allow for flexibility in time zones, the final project may be done individually or in a group of up to three students (you will be asked to evaluate team members' contributions in this case). Final written analyses are due July 29 at 11:59pm. Virtual oral presentations will be made at some time on July 30 or 31 (flexible timing to accommodate student schedules). You must turn in a write-up on time and present on July 23 or 24. More details will be provided during as the semester progresses.

*No late projects are accepted.*
<br> 
<br>

### Grade Calculation

The grading basis for this class is a traditional letter grade unless requested otherwise according to the standard university policy. The following table presents the contribution of each component to a student's final grade:

{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>     | <span></span>  
-----|----
Homework | 20%
Labs | 20%
Midterm Exam 1 | 15%
Midterm Exam 2 | 15%
Midterm Exam 3 | 15%
Final Project | 15%

A letter grade will be assigned as follows:  
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-center}
<span></span>     | <span></span>     | <span></span>    | <span></span>    |  <span></span>      
----|----|----|----|----
93 | &le; | A  | &le; | 100
90 | &le; | A- | &lt; | 93 
87 | &le; | B+ | &lt; | 90
83 | &le; | B  | &lt; | 87
80 | &le; | B- | &lt; | 83 
77 | &le; | C+ | &lt; | 80
73 | &le; | C  | &lt; | 77 
70 | &le; | C- | &lt; | 73 
67 | &le; | D+ | &lt; | 70
63 | &le; | D  | &lt; | 67 
60 | &le; | D- | &lt; | 63 
0  | &le; | F  | &lt; | 60 

I may assign an A+ grade in exceptional circumstances.
 
Although attendance in lecture and lab is not required, students are expected to keep up with the content contained in them according to the posted schedule. 

These posted cut points are guaranteed minimums. However, I may use more generous cut points depending on the overall difficulty of assignments and examinations; I will not adjust grades downward or require more stringent cut points. This course is not graded to a pre-specified distribution (i.e., "curved").

Regrade requests for homeworks, labs, and exams must be submitted within 48 hours of when the assignment is returned via Gradescope. Regrade requests will be honored if there is an error in the grade calculation or a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Note that regrades may result in a lower grade than originally given. No grades will be changed after the final project presentations. 

*Grades can only be changed by the instructor. Teaching Assistants cannot change grades on returned assignments.*

### Software, Texts, and Technology

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the software package for use in STA 198. The free user interface [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/) is highly recommended. All homework and lab assignments are to be completed in a reproducible R Markdown document and uploaded to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).

This course makes heavy use of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a collection of open source R packages (especially ggplot2 for visualization and dplyr for data manipulation). Finally, we will be using the collaborative version control system [git](https://git-scm.com/) as implemented in [GitHub](https://github.com/).

No textbooks are required for this course, but the following textbooks may be used as supplemental resources. All lecture notes will be posted to the class website.

All lectures will be posted to Sakai, with all live sessions (including labs and office hours) conducted remotely via Zoom. Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any technology issues.

### Absences and Late Work

If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic dean's office. Review the [Trinity excused absence policy](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work) for further details.

Exams missed in accordance with the excused absence policy will not count toward grade calculations; the other two exams will be up-weighted. However, you must take at least two exams, submit the final project write-up on time, and present the final project during the final exam period in order to pass the course.

**No late work is accepted,** although students automatically have the lowest homework and lab grades dropped.

### Testing Accommodations 

I am happy to provide virtual testing accommodations to students with a documented need. Please submit a Semester Request to the [Student Diability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) as soon as possible if you may require them. For instructions on how to register with SDAO, visit their website [here](https://access.duke.edu/requests). Note that accommodations are not retroactive; please request an accommodation as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>

### Inclusion & Class Etiquette 

Behavior in and out of the classroom should enhance the learning process. At all times we will use common courtesy and respectful behavior. In this course, we will strive to create a learning environment that is welcoming to all students and that is in alignment with [Duke's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion](https://provost.duke.edu/initiatives/commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion).

If there is any aspect of the class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me and/or your academic dean
<br>
<br>

### Where to find help

If you have a question, ask! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone. Occasionally, I may defer a question to office hours. Please be understanding -- it does not mean that I think your question is bad; we may simply be running behind. 
- Office hours are a valuable resource for more individual attention. Use them!
- Outside of class and office hours, general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Piazza site, since there are likely other students with the same questions.
- Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu/). The ARC offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke. Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more.
