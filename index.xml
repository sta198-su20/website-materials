      <description>Important Administrative Details STA 198L is a unique two-part online course that spans both summer sessions at Duke University. This course is split into two half-credit sessions: STA 198L-1 and STA 198L-2. Students must enroll in and complete both sections within the same summer in order to receive credit.
This course will be graded on the traditional letter scale. All students will receive a Z grade upon completion of STA 198L-1.</description>
