This lab will introduce web scraping of HTML web pages using CSS selector 
gadgets in R. This will not be assigned for a grade, but is rather meant to 
serve as a resource for your data science career (and may be helpful on your
final project!). The solutions for the exercises will be released on Wednesday,
July 15.

# HTML

HTML stands for **h**yper**t**ext **m**arkup **l**anguage, and describes the 
structure of a web page. Your browser interprets this structure and contents and 
displays the results. The basic building blocks include elements, tags, and 
attributes:
    - an element is a component of an HTML document
    - elements contain tags (start and end tag)
    - attributes provide additional information about HTML elements

```{r invite1, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.extra='style="background-color: #00539B; padding:2px; display: inline-block;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/html-structure.png")
```

A simple HTML document may look like the following:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Web Scraping</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Using rvest</h1>
<p>To get started...</p>

</body>
</html>
```

<br/><br/>

We can visualize this in a tree-like structure.

```{r, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.extra='style="background-color: #00539B; padding:2px; display: inline-block;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/html-tree.png")
```

If we have access to an HTML document, we can use the `rvest` package by 
Hadley Wickham to extract information. It makes basic processing and 
manipulation of HTML documents easy.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

Some core functions are as follows:

| Function            | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `xml2::read_html()` | read HTML from a character string or URL                          |
| `html_nodes()`      | select specified pieces from the HTML document using CSS selectors|
| `html_table()`      | parse an HTML table into a data frame                             |
| `html_text()`       | extract content                                                   |
| `html_name()`       | extract tag names                                                 |
| `html_attrs()`      | extract all attributes and values                                 |
| `html_attr()`       | extract value for a specified attribute's name                    |

# HTML in R

Let's create a simple HTML document as a string to demonstrate some of 
these functions.

```{r}
simple_html <- "<html>
<head>
<title>Web Scraping</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Using rvest</h1>
<p>To get started...</p>
</body>
</html>"
```

First, let's read it in:

```{r}
html_simple <- read_html(simple_html)
```

What does it look like?

```{r}
html_simple
```

Let's now extract the component corresponding to `Using rvest`, and the actual
text and name of the tag:

```{r}
h1_nodes <- html_nodes(html_simple, css = "h1")
h1_nodes

h1_nodes %>% 
  html_text()

h1_nodes %>% 
  html_name()
```

# Scaling up

Most HTML documents are not as simple as what we just examined. There may be
tables, hundreds of links, paragraphs of text, and more. Naturally, you might
wonder:
- How do we handle larger HTML documents? 
- How do we know what to provide to `css` in function `html_nodes()` when 
we attempt to subset the HTML document?
- Are these functions in `rvest` vectorized? For instance, are we able to get 
all the content in the `td` tags on the slide that follows?

In Chrome, you can view the HTML document associated with a web page by going
to `View > Developer > View Source`.

```html
<html lang=en>
<head>
   <title>Rays Notebook: Open Water Swims 2020 — The Whole Shebang</title>
</head>
<body>
<main class=schedule>
<h1>The Whole Shebang</h1>

<p>This schedule lists every swim in the database. 383 events.</p>

<table class=schedule>
<thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Location</th><th>Name</th><th>Distance</th><th>More</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>

<tr id=January>
<td class=date>Jan 12, Sun</td>
<td class=where>
   <a class=mapq href="http://www.google.com/maps/?q=27.865501,-82.631997">Petersburg, FL</a>
   <span class=more>
   Gandy Beach, Gandy Blvd N St, Petersburg, FL
   </span>
</td>
<td class=name><a href="http://tampabayfrogman.com/">Tampa Bay Frogman</a></td>
<td class=distance>5 km</td>
<td class=more><span class=time>7:15 AM</span>, Old Tampa Bay.</td>
</tr>
</body>
</html>
```

# CSS selectors

CSS stands for **c**ascading **s**tyle **s**heets, and describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
    - Inline: by using the style attribute in HTML elements
    - Internal: by using a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section
    - External: by using an external CSS file

To extract components out of HTML documents use `html_nodes()` and CSS selectors.
In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select elements you want to style. We can 
determine the necessary CSS selectors we need via the point-and-click
tool [selector gadget](https://selectorgadget.com/). More on this in a moment.

Examples of CSS selectors are given below:

| Selector          | Example         | `html_nodes()` `css` value           | Description; Select all                         |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| element           | `p`             | `html_nodes(x, css = "p")`           | &lt;p&gt; elements                              |
| element element   | `div p`         | `html_nodes(x, css = "div p")`       | &lt;p&gt; elements inside a &lt;div&gt; element |
| .class            | `.title`        | `html_nodes(x, css = ".title")`      | elements with class="title"                     |
| #id               | `#name`         | `html_nodes(x, css = "#name")`       | elements with id="name"                         |
| [attribute]       | `[class]`       | `html_nodes(x, css = "[class]")`     | elements with a class attribute                 |
| [attribute=value] | `[href='www']`  | `html_nodes(x, css = "[href='www']")`| elements with class="title"                     |

# SelectorGadget example

[SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) makes identifying the CSS 
selector you need by easily clicking on items on a webpage. Check out the [video here](https://player.vimeo.com/video/52055686) for more details.

Let's go to http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-1.html and scrape the first 
page of data on books with regard to their title, price, and star rating. 
We'll organize our results in a neatly formatted tibble similar to below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# A tibble: 20 x 3
   title                                             price rating
   <chr>                                             <chr> <chr> 
 1 A Light in the Attic                              £51.… Three 
 2 Tipping the Velvet                                £53.… One   
 3 Soumission                                        £50.… One   
 4 Sharp Objects                                     £47.… Four  
 5 Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind             £54.… Five  
 6 The Requiem Red                                   £22.… One   
 7 The Dirty Little Secrets of Getting Your Dream J… £33.… Four  
 8 The Coming Woman: A Novel Based on the Life of t… £17.… Three 
 9 The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their E… £22.… Four  
10 The Black Maria                                   £52.… One   
# … with 10 more rows
```

**The pre-recorded material will walk through this example in detail**.

# Overall workflow

The overall workflow for webscraping is as follows:

- Understand the website's hierarchy and what information you need.
- Read and save the HTML document from the URL.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    html_obj <- read_html("www.website-to-scrape.com")
    ```
- Use SelectorGadget to identify relevant CSS selectors.
- Subset the resulting html document using CSS selectors.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    html_obj %>% 
      html_nodes(css = "specified_css_selector")
    ```
- Further extract attributes, text, or tags by adding another layer with
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    html_obj %>% 
      html_nodes(css = "specified_css_selector") %>% 
      html_*()
    ```
   where `*` is `text`, `attr`, `attrs`, `name`, or `table`.

```{r, eval = T, echo = F}
page <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/chart/top")
titles <- page %>%
  html_nodes(".titleColumn a") %>%
  html_text()
years <- page %>%
  html_nodes(".secondaryInfo") %>%
  html_text() 
scores <- page %>%
  html_nodes(".imdbRating") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  as.numeric()
imdb_top_250 <- tibble(
  title = titles, 
  year = years, 
  score = scores
  )  
```

# Your turn!

Access the 250 top-rated movies according to their IMDb ratings, available here:
[https://www.imdb.com/chart/top](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top). 

Create a table which provides the titles, year, and IMDb scores for these 
movies. Your output should look similar to:

```{r, echo = F}
imdb_top_250
```
