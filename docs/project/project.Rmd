Interim check-in before **July 17**

Report, slides, and repository due **July 29, 11:59pm**

Presentations on **July 30 or July 31** 

# Introduction

**TLDR**: Pick (or create) a dataset and do something with it. That is your 
final project.

The final project for this class is based on the 
[**ASA COVID-19 Virtual Data Challenge**](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/datafest-covid19/).
There is a lot of work being done on modeling direct health outcomes of the 
COVID-19 pandemic such as prediction of new cases or mortality rates. However,
much less work is being done regarding the societal impacts of the pandemic 
*other* than its direct health outcomes. For example, you could explore 
associations involving COVID-19 vs. pollution levels, transportation, or 
working from home. You could investigate changes in the number of people 
posting on TikTok or do an analysis on online education. 

This project will consist of a written analysis of a COVID-19 related dataset of 
your own choosing or creation and an accompanying live presentation. This 
dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using by scraping 
the web or other means. The goal is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the 
techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply 
them to a dataset in a meaningful way.

# Brief project logistics

The final project may be done individually or in a group of up to *four* 
students. You may choose your lab groups, or form different groups if desired.

The three hard deliverables for the final project are

- A written, reproducible report detailing your analysis
- A GitHub repository corresponding to your report
- A brief set of slides that correspond to your intended oral presentation 
(ten minutes)

**Due Wednesday, July 29 at 11:59p US Eastern Time on Gradescope.**

Additionally, a brief, ten-minute virtual 
oral presentation will be made at some time on 
July 30 or 31 (flexible timing to accommodate schedules), and all group members 
must present. No late projects are accepted.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

Total                                                   | 100 pts
--------------------------------------------------------|--------
**Written report**                                      | 60 pts
**Slides**                                              | 15 pts
**Repository**                                          | 5 pts
**Live Presentation**                                   | 15 pts
**Overall neatness and presentation style**             | 5 pts

# Data sources

In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is 
important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should 
be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be 
explored. Ideally, your datasetâ€™s variables should include both categorical and 
continuous variables and have a sufficient number of observations.

You can use any dataset that is publicly available or openly licensed. There 
are many good resources available in GitHub. Some examples may be found on the
[**ASA challenge website here (scroll down a bit)**](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/datafest-covid19/resources.html). As well,
Dr. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel has put together a great collection of resources and
datasets [**available here**](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/covid19-r). 
However, note that most of the examples presented are health-outcomes related
and would thus not be suitable for the purposes of this project.

All analyses must be done in RStudio, and your final written report and 
analysis **must be reproducible**. This means that you must create an R Markdown
document attached to a GitHub repository that will create your written report
exactly upon knitting.

# Project ideas

Some resources for this final project are [**available here**](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/datafest-covid19/resources.html). Example
topics drawn from the ASA Challenge website (and that were submitted) are as
follows:

- Quantifying the effect of the pandemic on college experiences
- Examining associations between lockdown recommendations and policies on pollution
- Analyzing relative search interest in vivid/weird dreams during the pandemic
- Visualizing how the topics of COVID-19 publications in journals have varied 
through the course of the pandemic
- Creating interactive dashboards relating the pandemic to traffic patterns

# Project components

## Interim check-in

By July 17th, you/your group should have an idea of what your project will be
and the dataset that you will use. Before then, you must briefly check in with 
the instructor one-on-one (or group-on-one, but all members must be present).
This is to ensure that your project scope and dataset are appropriate.

## Written report

Your written report must be done using R Markdown. All team members must 
contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits/pushes. 
Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is 
turned off with the option `echo = FALSE`. 

You must turn in your proposal as a .pdf to Gradescope in order to receive 
credit. As well, it must match your GitHub repository *exactly*. The mandatory
components of the report are as follows, but feel free to expand with additional
sections as necessary. There is no page limit or requirement -- however, you
must comprehensively address all aspects below. Please be judicious in what you
decide to include in your final write-up.

The written report is worth 60 points, broken down as

Total                                                   | 60 pts
--------------------------------------------------------|--------
**Introduction/data**                                   | 10 pts
**Methodology**                                         | 20 pts
**Results**                                             | 20 pts
**Discussion**                                          | 10 pts

#### Introduction and data

The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data 
(where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the 
variables, etc.). 

#### Methodology 

The methodology section should include the variables used to address your 
research question, as well as any useful visualizations or summary statistics.
As well, you should introduce and justify the statistical method(s) that you 
believe will be useful in answering your research question. 

#### Results 

Showcase how you arrived at answers to 
your question using any techniques we have learned in this class (and some 
beyond, if you're feeling adventurous). Provide the main results from your
analysis. The goal is not to do an exhaustive 
data analysis (i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have 
learned for every variable), but rather let me know that you are proficient at 
asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, 
that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting 
and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your 
research questions. 

#### Discussion

This section is a conclusion and discussion. This will require a 
summary of what you have learned about your research question along with 
statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. Also, critique your own 
methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining 
to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the 
statistical analysis should also be discussed here. A paragraph on what you 
would do differently if you were able to start over with the project or what you 
would do next if you were going to continue work on the project should also be 
included.

## Repository

In addition to your Gradescope submissions, I will be checking your GitHub 
repository. This repository should be contributed to equally by all team members
and should include

- RMarkdown file (formatted to clearly present all of your code and results)
that will output the proposal and write-up in one document
- Meaningful README file on the GitHub repository that contains a *codebook*
for relevant variables
- Dataset(s) (in csv or RData format, in a `/data` folder)
- Presentation (if using Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides, export to PDF and put 
in repo, in a `/presentation` folder)

Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make 
sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted.

## Slides

In addition to the write-up, your team must also create presentation
slides that summarize and showcase your project. Introduce your research question 
and dataset, showcase visualizations, and provide some conclusions. These slides
should serve as a brief visual accompaniment to your write-up and will be graded 
for content and quality. For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document
to be submitted to Gradescope.

## Presentation

Sometime during July 30 or 31st, you/your group will make a live presentation 
via Zoom using your slides. All group members must be present and contribute
during the presentation. To allow for different time zones, I will be quite 
flexible on when the presentation is. A sign-up link will be provided closer to
the deadline.

# Overall notes

The project is very open ended. For instance, in creating a compelling 
visualization(s) of your data in R, there is no limit on what tools or 
packages you may use. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A 
single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large 
number of poor quality visualizations.

Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is 
turned off with the option `echo = FALSE`. 

Finally, pay attention to details in your write-up and presentation. Neatness, 
coherency, and clarity will count.


# Tips

- Ask questions if any of the expectations are 
unclear.

- *Code*: In your write up your code should be hidden (`echo = FALSE`) so that 
your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include 
all your code such that if I re-knit your Rmd file I should be able to obtain 
the results you presented. **Exception:** If you want to highlight something 
specific about a piece of code, you're welcome to show that portion. 

#### If working on a team:

- Merge conflicts will 
happen, issues will arise, and thatâ€™s fine! Commit and push often, and ask 
questions when stuck.

- Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and 
quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team 
members).

- All team members are 
expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group 
assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have 
sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. 
While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it 
is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code 
and approaches in 
the assignment works.

- You will be asked to fill out an anonymous survey where you 
rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member. This survey may modify
the individual grade received by each group member. 

# Grading

Grading of the project will take into account the following:

- Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy 
of data to those questions?
- Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?
- Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, 
writing, and explanations?
- Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the 
limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into 
the planning and implementation of the project?

A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:

- *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical 
concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in 
the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.
- *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together 
an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates 
most results clearly to others.
- *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several 
areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication 
of results is sometimes unclear.
- *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding 
of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication 
of results is unclear.
- *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.

# Late work policy

**There is no late work accepted on this project.** Be sure to turn in your 
work early to avoid any technological mishaps.

**If you do not turn in your final project on time, you will not pass the course.**
